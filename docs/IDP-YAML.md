spec:

  dev: 
    watched:
      # On the local machine, which path to watch, from the root folder of the project.
      # For example /codewind-workspace/my-project would be /
      watchDir: /src # Optional, otherwise assumed to be the root /
      ignoredPaths: # Same format as filewatcher, Optional, if not specified then no excludes.
      - /target
      - /some.file

    uploadFilter: # Unclear if we can just combine this with watch, or if it needs to be separate
      ignoredPaths: # Same format as filewatcher, Optional, if not specified then no excludes.
      - /target

    typeDetection: # Optional: Rules that are used to detect if this IDP is applicable to a given project (eg OpenLiberty IDP for an OpenLiberty-based app)
    # At least one rule must match for a type; ie this is an OR clause list, not an AND clause list.
    - pathSelector: # At least one 'pathSelector' entry must exist if typeDetection is specified
        # Optional, Either a 'rootPath' xor a 'filenameWildcard' must be specified
        rootPath: # example: /pom.xml, or /go.mod
        filenameWildcard: # example: server.xml, or *.go; this means recursively walk a project and look for filenames that match this pattern. Same pattern style as filewatcher.
      textStringsToMatch: # Optional: If a file matches one of the selectors, then look for at least one of these strings (ie OR clause list, not AND clause list). 
      - net.wasdev.wlp.maven.plugins # Example: if this ID is found in the file, then this IDP should be considered to be applicable to the project

      # Whether a task container will be disposed of after the scenario has completed.

#### Update History:
- September 16th: Remove `kind`, update `github-id` to `githubId`
- September 17th: Remove `buildImage: docker.io/maven:3.6` from `server-start`, remove `maven-cache-volume` volume, removed `spec.shared.volumes.labels` and `spec.shared.volumes.accessModes`. `env` updated to Kuberenetes-style `key/value`, to allow easy parsing.
